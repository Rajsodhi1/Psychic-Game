# Psychic-Game
Here is a simple in-browser guesssing game. The object is to see if you can guess the random letter the computer has chosen. You only have 9 total guess otherwise you lose. Wins, losses, letters guessed and guesses remaining are displayed for the user.

Technologies used:
The admittedly simple layout was made using HTML, with plans to dress it up using the Bootstrap library as well as CSS techniques.
THe game mechanics were made using Javascript. 
Everything is included in the main index file, however that can get messy very quickly with more complex apps, it is good practice to separate scripts and styling into different files and link them to the main file.
